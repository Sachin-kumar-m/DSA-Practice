Subsequence : sequence generated by delteing zero or more elements from the array

empty array can be a Subsequence
all elements can also be a Subsequence
the Subsequence elemets should be in order. respect the indexes.

difference between subarrays aand subsequences
subarray will be continous part of the array. but subsequence is also a part but no rule that it has to be continous, but has to mainitain the order


every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence need not be a subarray 

subsets:
subsets are same as subsequence but the order does not matter

if we sort, subsets will not changes. but subsequence will change. 

count of subsequences and subsets are 2^N, where N being the length of the array.
